# Dashboard for WinForms - How to add window calculations for numeric measures in code

This example illustrates how to use API methods and properties to apply [window calculations](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116917) to the values of the specified measure.

The application contains a [DashboardViewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117122) control and performs the following tasks:

- creates an empty [tabbed dashboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116693)
- loads a sample dashboard to the first tab page
- copies the dashboard items and layout to the second tab page
- applies window calculations to the values displayed in the [Pivot](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15266) and [Scatter Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/114805) dashboard items
- starts the timer to switch pages.

You can click the page to stop the timer and click again to restart.

The example screenshot is shown below:
